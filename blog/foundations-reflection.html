        <h4>
          What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due to the core
          learning?
        </h4>
        <p>
          The first new thing for me is to think like a programmer. It is very important as I am
          switching from a very different background to tech. I need to understand it thoroughly and
          make it my new habit, especially in problem-solving.
        </p>
        <p>
          The second is I need to develop a growth mindset in my learning. It plays an important
          role in determining the outcome of the course and how successful I can be in the future.
        </p>
        <p>
          The third thing I have learned is how important to work effectively with other people in a
          coding project is. I will do not work alone but work with other people. Co-operating well
          helps the job be done smoothly. If I get stuck, there will be someone who can help me
          solve the problems.
        </p>
        <h4>
          What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming?
        </h4>
        <p>
          I think personal values can direct every part of my learning. Knowing what are important
          to me keep me motivated in working to get what I want. Self-awareness is very important.
          After each sprint, reflecting on what I have done well or not well enough help me improve
          in the next time. Empathy helps me understand and work well with other people in the
          cohort.
        </p>
        <h4>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h4>
        <p>
          Before the course, I was wondering how EDA students can become successful developers after
          such a short time course. I thought that it would teach a huge amount of technical
          knowledge to students, but in fact, what surprised me the most is that EDA has put so much
          effort to equip students with human skills. It is really important like the way it is
          named "core learning". The content is interesting and helpful for any kind of job but
          especially it was well selected to teach technical students. I used to think that I knew
          these skills but this is the first time I spent that amount of time learning about it
          seriously.
        </p>
        <h4>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h4>
        <p>
          The most challenging part of core learning for me was exploring my own identity, values
          and strengths. Understanding myself thoroughly is not easy. It took me quite an amount of
          time to think and write it down.
        </p>
        <h4>
          Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core
          learning in a web development Bootcamp course?
        </h4>
        <p>
          Devacademy is spending so much time focusing on core learning because to become a good
          developer, the core skills/ human skills are the must-have ones. The technical skills are
          also important but they can be improved when you work and it will be not too hard when you
          have good human skills.
        </p>
        <h4>
          Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you
          have just used that time to practise programming instead? Justify your answer.
        </h4>
        <p>
          No, I don't think it was a waste of time. It helped me understand clearly what I need to
          plan and engagage in study.
