        <h4>1. Being blocked on a problem</h4>
        <p>
          In this sprint, there were many times I was blocked because I did not understand how to
          use the functions properly. I would not call them simple problems because they may be
          simple with an experienced coder but not with a beginner. To solve them, I read the error
          messages, re-read and re-do them in other ways to see if anything changed. Referring just
          only one site is not enough for me, I need to google many examples to master how to use
          it.
        </p>

        <h4>2. Elegantly solved a problem</h4>
        <p>
          The hardest challenge for me was Gradebook kata as there are many objects, strings,
          functions that need to put together and it was so confusing. I don't know if I can say I
          solved it elegantly or not. I tried googling and reading error message but I was still
          blocked. I also tried to break it into small parts, using pseudocode made it a bit clearer
          but still did not reach the goal. Luckily, Joseph made the live coaching session and
          it helped me solve this kata.
        </p>

        <h4>3. Reflect on problem solving technique</h4>
        <p><strong>Pseudocode:</strong></p>
        <p>
          I try to follow the instruction of the challenge and break it into smaller steps. I like
          this technique and I understand it is really really important but somehow I feel I cannot
          express the task properly and clearly in words. And it becomes “ too many words” that
          messes with the main coding so after finishing coding I cleaned it up.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Trying something:</strong></p>
        <p>I try it many times and it helps.</p>

        <p><strong>Rubber ducky method:</strong></p>
        <p>
          I haven’t tried. First time I learnt about it and I was surprised by how simple and
          logical it is. It works even with non-coding problems. Definitely, I will try it.
        </p>

        <p><strong>Reading error messages:</strong></p>
        <p>They help me to see exactly where the problem is and suggest how to fix it.</p>

        <p><strong>Console.logging:</strong></p>
        <p>It is very helpful to see whether I am on the right track.</p>

        <p><strong>Googling</strong></p>
        <p>
          Yes, I try to google the syntax, method, etc again and again to be sure that I don’t make
          mistakes because of the wrong use.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Asking your peers for help:</strong></p>
        <p>
          So far I haven’t made a lot of questions for my cohort but I saw many of the questions are
          the same as mine and I got the answers from those.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Asking coaches for help</strong></p>
        <p>
          I don't hesitate to ask for help but still haven't utilized my chance. In sprint 3 and 4,
          the live sessions with Joseph were really in time and helped me a lot.
        </p>
        <p><strong> Your process with reflection</strong></p>
        <p>
          Reflection is a good way to improve my skills. After finishing a code, I come back and
          check it on another day before the due date, think about whether I can do it in a better
          way. I am trying to make it my habit.
