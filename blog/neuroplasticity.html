        <h4>How understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits people</h4>
        <p>
          Neuroplasticity is the brain's ability to change and adapt as a result of experience. It
          happens throughout life eventhough can be significant at the young age.
        </p>
        <p>
          With the understanding of neuroplasticity, people have built up many learning programms to
          maximize human's brain capacity since the very young age like baby. It also provides the
          principles for restoring the brain's functions through rehabilitation after brain damaging
          such as stroke or traumatic injuries.
        </p>
        <h4>
          Discuss how you might engage with the principles of neuroplasticity for your benefit
        </h4>
        <p>
          Understanding the principles of neuroplasticity helped me realize that it is never too
          late to study new things at any age, as long as I can keep good learning habits and
          environment, maintaining a good life styles to maximize the brain neuroplasticity.
        </p>
        <h4>How to improve your neuroplasticity</h4>
        <p>
          There are some ways to help encourage your brain to adapt and change, at any age.
          <li>
            <i>Enrich your learning environment</i> by learning new languages, musical
            instruments, reading, creating art, travelling, etc.
          </li>
          <li>
            <i>Get plenty of rest</i>. Sleep plays an important role in the growth of
            neuron dendrites which are used to transmit information, so that improve the brain
            plasticity.
          </li>
          <li>
            <i>Exercise regularly</i> because regular physical activities prevent neuron
            loss and improve neuron formation.
          </li>

        <h4>What is Growth Mindset and why it is relevant?</h4>
        <p>
          Growth Mindset is the belief that you can cultivate and improve upon your abilities
          through practice and effort.
        </p>
        <p>
          It differs significantly from a “Fixed Mindset,” which says that one’s ability is largely
          predetermined and unchangeable.
        </p>
        <p>
          Having a growth mindset is important because it can help you overcome obstacles when
          learning something new or developing a new skill. The world is changing very fast and
          there are always new challenges we must face every day.
        </p>
        <h4>Did anything surprise you?</h4>

        I realized that almost the failure I have had in my life are due to my fixed mindset. I
        would do better if I thought I could make it.

        <h4>How will you integrate growth mindset into your learning journey?</h4>
        <p>
          Definitely, developing growth mindset is very important in my learning. I will be happy to
          take the new challenges as a chance to learn and grow. If I believe I can do, I will be
          able to achieve that.
