        <h4>1. What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h4>
        <p>
          This course is my first step to become a tech person. After this
          intensive course, I need to work continuously to become a skillful and
          confident web developer as soon as possible.
        </p>
        <h4>
          2. A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to
          learning
        </h4>
        <p>
          Strength: My strengths are self management skills and organization
          skills. I like to plan and organize everything for myself and my
          family. When there are so many things to learn that can make me
          overloaded, I will make a plan of the tasks, set the priority for the
          must do tasks and follow. If I become too stressful, I will leave it
          temporally, do my favourite stuffs and come back to study after
          relieving stress.
        </p>
        <p>
          Limitation: English is my second language and most of all, technical
          terms are challenging for me now as all the concepts are new to me.
          There is no other way but to spend time to study everyday.
        </p>
        <h4>
          3. What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see
          developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?
        </h4>
        <p>
          I want to improve my ability to work on my own (self-research and
          practice) and my teamwork skills (communication skills, colaboration
          skills) with other people in technical field.
        </p>
        <h4>
          4. A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme
        </h4>
        <p>
          I will make a to-do list, and set a goal at the beginning of the day.
          I prioritise the tasks based on the importance. In case I cannot
          handle it, I will ask for help from my peer if we are on the same
          project. Otherwise, I can ask for advices from my facililator on how
          to manage the workload or negotiate the deadline.
        </p>
        <h4>
          5. What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to
          you
        </h4>
        <p>
          Things may become overloaded to me during the course as I am a new to
          this tech field, but I think I am good at dealing with stresses. I
          will leave the task temporarily, do my favourite things such as
          cooking or watching movies and then come back after relieving the
          stress. I will seek help when I think I should do.
        </p>
        <h4>
          6. A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way
        </h4>
        <p>
          If I get stuck, I will try to find the solution from Google first. If
          I still cannot solve it, I will seek help from other learner and
          finally I can contact my facilator through Discord channels.
        </p>
        <h4>7. A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team</h4>
        <p>
          Coaching feedback from Facilitation team would be very helpful to
          improve myself.
        </p>
        <h4>
          8. Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are
          committed to other things. For example, you might have whƒÅnau
          commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.
        </h4>
        <p>
          I have a family with two young kids. My husband is helping me with
          school drop-offs until the end of bootcamp, but I am the only one
          person to cook in the evening. I do not mind working in late at night
          or at weekend and I do not make any vacation plan until the end of
          bootcamp. In case anything unexpectedly come up, I will contact my
          facilitator to consult.
