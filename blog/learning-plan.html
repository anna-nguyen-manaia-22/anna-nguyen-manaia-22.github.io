            <h4 class="is-size-4">What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</h4>
            <p>
              My long-term goal is to become a web developer. After this course, I want to be
              confident enough to apply for a junior developer position. IT field's changing pace is
              very fast and long life self-learning is indispensable. From this course, I want to
              gain as many skills as I can so that later on I can continue to learn by myself.
            </p>
            <h4 class="is-size-4">
              What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp?
            </h4>
            <p>
              <i>Strengths:</i> My strengths are self-management skills and organization skills. I
              am having great support from my family during this course but still, I need to do a
              lot of things for my kids. I think I can plan and organize everything well to have
              time to study during Bootcamp. I always have positive thoughts that help me balance
              myself whenever things become overloaded or stressful for me.
            </p>
            <p>
              <i>Limitations:</i> English is my second language so it will be challenging for me to
              communicate with other people while working in a group. I am getting used to IT
              terminology but I still need to learn many new concepts in this field.
            </p>
            <h4 class="is-size-4">
              What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be?
            </h4>
            <p>
              My biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be working with other people in a
              group. I need to communicate well, be able to explain what I am thinking in technical
              English.
            </p>
            <h4 class="is-size-4">
              What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see developed in yourself
              while at Dev Academy?
            </h4>
            <p>
              The same as in Foundation Learning Plan, I want to improve my ability to work on my
              own (self-research and practice) and my teamwork skills (communication skills,
              colaboration skills) with other people when working on the same project.
            </p>
            <h4>What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team?</h4>
            <p>
              Through the Foundation, I feel that I always have the support and timely guidance from
              the team. I am confident that I will also get positive support for both technical
              problems as well as personal problems during Bootcamp.
            </p>
            <h4 class="is-size-4">What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp</h4>
            <p>
              I hope I can learn and practice coding as much as possible in Bootcamp, as well as
              strengthen my problem solving skills.

            <p>
              This course is my first step to become a tech person. After this intensive course, I
              need to work continuously to become a skillful and confident web developer as soon as
              possible.

              A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning
            </h4>
            <p>
              Strength: My strengths are self management skills and organization skills. I like to
              plan and organize everything for myself and my family. When there are so many things
              to learn that can make me overloaded, I will make a plan of the tasks, set the
              priority for the must do tasks and follow. If I become too stressful, I will leave it
              temporally, do my favourite stuffs and come back to study after relieving stress.
            </p>
            <p>
              Limitation: English is my second language and most of all, technical terms are
              challenging for me now as all the concepts are new to me. There is no other way but to
              spend time to study everyday.

              What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see developed in

            </h4>
            <p>
              I want to improve my ability to work on my own (self-research and practice) and my
              teamwork skills (communication skills, colaboration skills) with other people in
              technical field.

              A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme
            </h4>
            <p>
              I will make a to-do list, and set a goal at the beginning of the day. I prioritise the
              tasks based on the importance. In case I cannot handle it, I will ask for help from my
              peer if we are on the same project. Otherwise, I can ask for advices from my
              facililator on how to manage the workload or negotiate the deadline.
            </p>
            <h4 class="is-size-4">
              What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you
            </h4>
            <p>
              Things may become overloaded to me during the course as I am a new to this tech field,
              but I think I am good at dealing with stresses. I will leave the task temporarily, do
              my favourite things such as cooking or watching movies and then come back after
              relieving the stress. I will seek help when I think I should do.
            </p>
            <h4 class="is-size-4">
              A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way
            </h4>
            <p>
              If I get stuck, I will try to find the solution from Google first. If I still cannot
              solve it, I will seek help from other learner and finally I can contact my facilator
              through Discord channels.
            </p>

            <p>
              I have a family with two young kids. My husband is helping me with school drop-offs
              until the end of bootcamp, but I am the only one person to cook in the evening. I do
              not mind working in late at night or at weekend and I do not make any vacation plan
              until the end of bootcamp. In case anything unexpectedly come up, I will contact my
              facilitator to consult.
