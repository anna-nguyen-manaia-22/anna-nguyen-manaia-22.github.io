        <h4>1. Describe the difference between EQ and IQ</h4>
        <p>
          <strong>IQ ( intelligence quotient)</strong> is a measure of a person’s reasoning ability.
          It is supposed to gauge how well someone can use information and logic to answer questions
          or make predictions.
        </p>
        <p>IQ represents abilities such as:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Visual and spatial processing</li>
          <li>Knowledge of the world</li>
          <li>Fluid reasoning</li>
          <li>Quantitative reasoning</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          <strong>EQ (Emotional quotient or Emotional intelligence)</strong> refers to a person's
          ability to perceive, control, evaluate, and express emotions.
        </p>

        <p>IQ focuses on abilities such as:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Identifying emotions of their own and other people</li>
          <li>Controlling their's own emotions</li>
          <li>Understand and empathize with other</li>
          <li>Relating to others via communication and non-communication methods</li>
          <li>Communicate effectively</li>
          <li>Solve the conflict with others</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>2. Describe why EQ is important and how it is relevant to you</h4>
        <p>
          IQ used to be recognized as a key element of success, especially in the academic field.
          People with high IQs may do well in school, and earn more money. But in fact, it is not
          always like that. A high IQ is not a guarantee of success in life. In contrast, EQ is more
          important than IQ to become successful.
        </p>

        <p>
          EQ helps people manage stress and performance when they have a hard time. So it can be
          said that EQ can affect one’s mental and physical health. If someone cannot control the
          stress, it can cause insomnia, depression, immune system suppression and then lead to
          other serious health problems.
        </p>

        <p>
          EQ affects the relationship with other people at work. Understanding their feeling and
          knowing to control them, understanding and expressing empathy to others help to build good
          relationships at work. People who communicate well, and collaborate well with others can
          get the job done effectively. High EQ is an important quality for business leaders and
          managers.
        </p>

        <p>
          Thinking about EQ is more serious for me when I decided to switch my career to this tech
          world where I will mostly work with the computer. I will ultilize EQ which I have gained
          from my previous job in customer care serives to be successful in this new field.
