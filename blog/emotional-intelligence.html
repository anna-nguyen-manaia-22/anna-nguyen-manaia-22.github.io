            <p>
              <strong>IQ ( intelligence quotient)</strong> is a measure of a person’s reasoning
              ability. It is supposed to gauge how well someone can use information and logic to
              answer questions or make predictions.
            </p>
            <p>IQ represents abilities such as:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Visual and spatial processing</li>
              <li>Knowledge of the world</li>
              <li>Fluid reasoning</li>
              <li>Quantitative reasoning</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              <strong>EQ (Emotional quotient or Emotional intelligence)</strong> refers to a
              person's ability to perceive, control, evaluate, and express emotions.
            </p>

            <p>IQ focuses on abilities such as:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Identifying emotions of their own and other people</li>
              <li>Controlling their's own emotions</li>
              <li>Understand and empathize with other</li>
              <li>Relating to others via communication and non-communication methods</li>
              <li>Communicate effectively</li>
              <li>Solve the conflict with others</li>
            </ul>

            <h4 class="is-size-4">Describe why EQ is important and how it is relevant to you</h4>
            <p>
              IQ used to be recognized as a key element of success, especially in the academic
              field. People with high IQs may do well in school, and earn more money. But in fact,
              it is not always like that. A high IQ is not a guarantee of success in life. In
              contrast, EQ is more important than IQ to become successful.
            </p>
            <p>
              EQ helps people manage stress and performance when they have a hard time. So it can be
              said that EQ can affect one’s mental and physical health. If someone cannot control
              the stress, it can cause insomnia, depression, immune system suppression and then lead
              to other serious health problems.
            </p>
            <p>
              EQ affects the relationship with other people at work. Understanding their feeling and
              knowing to control them, understanding and expressing empathy to others help to build
              good relationships at work. People who communicate well, and collaborate well with
              others can get the job done effectively. High EQ is an important quality for business
              leaders and managers.
            </p>
            <p>
              Thinking about EQ is more serious for me when I decided to switch my career to this
              tech world where I will mostly work with the computer. I will ultilize EQ which I have
              gained from my previous job in customer care serives to be successful in this new
              field.
