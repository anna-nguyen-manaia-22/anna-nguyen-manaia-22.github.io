        <h4>
          1. Explain a situation where you have had an ethical decision to make.
          Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the
          decision you made, and the consequences of your action.
        </h4>
        <p>
          When I was applying for a new position at a new company, the recruiter
          asked me to send them a copy of the previous staff ID card as evidence
          that I was working in the industry at that time. The staff ID card has
          the ID number that belongs to the company that I was working for so I
          think I should not reveal it. Aware of this, I discussed with the
          recruiter about my concern and they accepted the copy of my card with
          the ID number covered. Then they thanked me for showing
          professionalism.
        </p>

        <h4>
          2. Describe how your culture has influenced your values and identity.
        </h4>
        <p>
          I am from an Asian culture where hardworking, loyalty and family are
          well respected. Those things are affecting the way I live and work. I am
          honest and truthful to people around me. I always try my best to do
          the job I am given. My family is always the most important thing in my
          life. I am always looking for a work-life balance so that I can have
          time to take care of my family while doing my favourite job.
        </p>

        <h4>
          3. Evaluate your strengths and limitations in terms of your learning and
          career development
        </h4>
        <p>
          I can relate to people and adapt to different environments as I used
          to live in 3 different countries since I was 20. I also have good
          organizational skills which help me to manage my duties at work and at
          home. English is one of my limitations as I am not an English native
          speaker but I am working hard to improve it.
        </p>

        <h4>
         4. Identify which of your strengths might help you in your learning
          journey and how they intersect with learning obstacles.
        </h4>
        <p>
          I think both of my two strengths can help me in adapt quickly to the
          new learning environment as well as dealing with learning challenges.
        </p>

        <h4>
          5. Share an example from your experience of where you were trying to work
          productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss
          the strategies you used at that time, how effective they were, and
          your reflections on what other strategies you would try now and why.
